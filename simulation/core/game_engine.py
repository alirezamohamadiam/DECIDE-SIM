"""
Main simulation engine that orchestrates the multi-agent survival simulation.

This module contains the Game class, which is the central controller for the entire
simulation. It manages the game loop, agent interactions, action execution, and
state updates. The engine integrates the hormonal system, memory streams, and
LLM-powered decision making to create a complex, emergent simulation.

Key Features:
- Turn-based simulation loop with configurable duration
- Agent action collection and execution
- Hormonal system integration (cortisol, endorphin)
- Memory stream management for learning
- Comprehensive logging and state tracking
- Resource management and crisis detection
