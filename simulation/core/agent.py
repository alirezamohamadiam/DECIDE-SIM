# simulation/core/agent.py
"""
Defines the Agent class, its thinking process, and its interaction with the simulation.

This module contains the core Agent class that represents AI agents in the simulation.
Each agent uses a Large Language Model (LLM) to make decisions based on their current
state, hormonal influences, and past experiences. The agent's decision-making process
is designed to simulate human-like reasoning with emotional and physiological influences.

Key Features:
- LLM-powered decision making with structured reasoning
- Integration with hormonal system (cortisol, endorphin)
- Memory stream for learning from past experiences
- Contextual awareness of game state and other agents

    Represents an AI agent in the simulation.

    Think of each agent as a little AI person trying to survive in this virtual world.
    They're powered by a Large Language Model (like ChatGPT) that helps them think and decide.
    The agent's behavior gets influenced by several things:
    - What's happening in the game right now and what resources are available
    - Their hormonal levels (cortisol for guilt, endorphin for cooperation)
    - Memories of past experiences that shape their decisions
    - Their current goals and what they need to do next

    The agent thinks in two steps, just like we do:
    1. First, they figure out a big-picture goal based on the situation
    2. Then, they pick a specific action to work toward that goal
